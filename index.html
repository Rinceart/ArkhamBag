            <p class="label_description">
              Arkham Bag is a chaos bag simulator for Arkham Horror: The Card
              Game, based on H. P. Lovecraft&apos;s Cthulhu mythos. The app
              provides a quick and easy way to simulate the game&apos;s chaos
              bag, supporting game mechanics all the way to the Edge of the
              Earth campaign. Arkham Bag also contains quick access to player
              aid in the form of phase sequences with player windows.</p>

                Arkham Bag is an event simulator for role playing and board games. 
                The app contains a large number of tokens, all with different values and symbols. 
                Assign events to these tokens, throw them into the “bag” in any combination, 
                and draw them one by one to simulate random events.
